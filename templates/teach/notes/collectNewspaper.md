This is the first practice problem for the day.  It gives students practice writing their first Karel program.  We want to emphasize decomposition and defining their own Karel commands.  Rather than writing out all the Karel commands in a list, we want to encourage students to think from the "top down" to define higher-level commands, such as "turn right", to break down their solution.
