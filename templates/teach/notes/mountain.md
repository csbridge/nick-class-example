problemtitle: Mountain Karel

This is the first project for the morning.  It gives students practice with control flow, specifically `while` loops (decomposition is also important).  The challenge is the program should work in a variety of worlds.  Generalized programs are important, but hard, so you may need to walk students through these concepts.  The hardest part is looping to ascend and descend the mountain, knowing the condition to use and what step to take each time.  When helping students with loop conditions, it can help to talk through what it is that may no longer be true once we want the loop to stop that is true when we want the loop to continue.

**Milestone:** ascend the mountain
