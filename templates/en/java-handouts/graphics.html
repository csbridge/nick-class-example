				</p>

					<div class="well"><code>
						getWidth(); // returns the width of the screen. <br>
						getHeight(); // returns the height of the screen.<br>
						add(<i>object</i>); // adds an object to the screen.<br>
                        add(<i>object</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>); // adds an object to the screen at coordinates (x, y).<br>
						remove(<i>object</i>); // removes an object from the screen.<br>
						getElementAt(<i>x</i>, <i>y</i>); // returns the element at (x, y).
					</code></div>

                <h3>GLabel</h3>
                <p>Recall that setLocation(x,y) sets the <i>origin</i> of a GRect, GOval, or GLine to the coordinates (x,y), where the origin is defined as the top-left corner. GLabel has the same definition of origin, but the height is defined a bit taller than the actual text height. Here is a detailed look at all the different height definitions for GLabel:</p>
				<center><img style="width:700px;" src="{{pathToRoot}}img/handouts/graphics/GLabelGeometry.png"></img></center>
				<br/>
                <p>
                Side note: The origin is the middle-left in the image above, because we are dealing with a multi-line GLabel. For GLabels with single lines, the origin is the top-left.
                </p>
                <p>
                So to center a GLabel vertically, we would actually use the <i>ascent</i> of a GLabel:
                </p>
					<div class="well"><code>
                        double y = getHeight()/2 + label.getAscent()/2;
					</code></div>

                <h3>GImage</h3>
                <p>You can also upload your own images and add them to your graphics program!</p>
                <p>A few tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Save your image to the same "src" (source) folder that contains your java file.</li>
                    <li>Find where your java file is located by going to Eclipse, right-clicking on the java file in Project Explorer (the left-hand menu), and going to "Properties."</li>
                    <li>If you are still having errors, make sure you can see the image file in Eclipse. Refresh the project (right-click the project folder in Eclipse and select "Refresh").</li>
                </ul>
