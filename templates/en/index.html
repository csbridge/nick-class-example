	<h2>The Idea of the Course</h2>

	<p>The point of this three week course is to teach you the fundamentals of computer programming to the point where you can go and learn on your own. It is taught by a collaboration of instructors from Stanford University, CTU, and Ko√ß. You will learn to program using material for Stanford's Introduction to Computer Science course.</p>

	<p>Meet Karel, The Java Robot that Stanford uses to introduce university students to programming. </p>

	<p>Use Karel's commands to get her to move the beeper to the top of the ledge. Normally you will write your programs in an application called Eclipse, but to get you started we made a mini-eclipse for our website:
