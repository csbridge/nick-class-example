title: Accessing Student Submissions

[TOC]

## Submission Overview

Students submit their code to Edstem twice a day. **It is okay if they don't finish everything, or if they are still working.** We just want to know that they are keeping up with the material. Please be sure to give this messaging to your session <u>in the first tea time</u>. 

They will also need to submit their code for office hours and debugging help. They do not need to submit if they have onceptual questions or are looking for general problem-solving approaches. They can resubmit as many times as they want.

## 1. Ed Lessons: View student submissions

Once a student submits their code, you will be able to view their code and try it out in your own PyCharm application. The code is available via Lessons on [Ed](https://us.edstem.org/courses/968/discussion/).

</center>

Click on the correct lesson for the session (correct day and correct time, morning or evening). For example, for the first day, click on "Day 1 PM".

On the Slide that pops up, click on Submissions. You should see the submissions of yourself (even if you don't have any). Click on your name or the X button to view all students, and you can click on the particular student whom you are helping.

## 2. Helping a student in Office Hours

Sometimes you can help the student just by looking at the code on Edstem. Other times, you will need to download and run the code on your own machine. Here are two ways to do so.

Note that while you can open up a Terminal in Ed, the Ed workspace does not support Karel or Graphics, both of which require tkinter (Python graphics library) support. You will need to run these types of programs in PyCharm.

### Option 1: Copy-paste to local project

This is the easier option. Download the starter project from the front page and open in PyCharm. Then copy-paste from Ed into the starter project on PyCharm.

### Option 2: Download all files as a zip

Open the Tree view in the Ed workspace view ("Toggle Tree View" while viewing a particular student's particular submission). Then, right-click anywhere in the file explorer/tree view and select Download All.

The file will be a `home.zip`, which you can unzip and then import into PyCharm.
