Karel wants to walk across the Stanford/CTU/Ko√ß campus and spruce it up a bit for Spring. Spring has sprung, but the campus trees haven't gotten the memo and are still leafless. Karel needs to walk across campus from west to east, adorning all trees with artificial leaves and transforming the campus as follows:

</center>

The problem is complicated because Karel doesn't know how tall each tree is, nor does it know the distances between trees. Karel does know, however, that it has just enough beepers in its beeper bag starting out to decorate all of the trees, and that the world (the CTU campus) is 9 spaces wide. Try to intuit the program requirement by looking at the two snapshots here (the world above is called `banish_winter.w`. Your program must also work for the configuration below (`banish_winter2.w`):

</center>

How can we write a program that works in any world that satisfies the above requirements?
